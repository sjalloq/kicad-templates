<h2>RPI-BC Expansion Board</h2>

<p>This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the
<a href="http://www.phoenixcontact.com/us/products/2202874" target="blank">Phoenix Contact RPI-BC industrial housing for the Raspberry Pi.</a>
<br> This board is designed to mount on the RPi 40-pin GPIO header and provides external connections via four 4-pin PTSM feed-through headers.<br>
</p>

<p>This base project includes a PCB edge as specified by the DXF downloaded from the RPI-BC INT-PCB SET <a href="https://www.phoenixcontact.com/us/products/2202994" target="blank">product page</a>
with the connectors placed correctly to align the two boards.
All IO present on the Raspberry-Pi board is connected to the project through the
0.1" expansion headers. The 4-pin 2.5mm pitch PTSM feed-through connectors are also present. </p>
